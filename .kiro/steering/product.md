# Product Overview

Snappy is a desktop automation assistant for web-based messaging platforms. It's an Electron app that opens messaging sites (Snapchat Web, Twitter DMs, etc.) in a browser window, lets you log in manually, then injects automation scripts that watch for incoming messages and send human-like replies based on configurable rules.

Think of it as a universal browser assistant that sits on top of any messaging site and reacts for you - detecting new messages, deciding whether to reply, and typing responses that look natural.

## Core Value

- Universal: Works on any web messaging platform
- Manual auth: You handle login, 2FA, captchas
- Rule-based: Simple keyword matching for MVP, designed for future AI integration
- Human-like: Realistic typing delays, random pauses, rate limiting to avoid detection
- Local-first: Runs on your machine with your own accounts

## Target Use Cases

- Auto-responding to common questions on social platforms
- Maintaining presence in conversations when busy
- Testing ground for multi-account automation strategies
- Foundation for AI-powered conversational agents
